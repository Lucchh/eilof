[![MIT License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green)][MIT License]

EILOF is a Python package for outlier detection in data streams using an optimized incremental implementation of the Local Outlier Factor (LOF). It is based on the research paper ‚ÄúAn Efficient Outlier Detection Algorithm for Data Streaming‚Äù (publication forthcoming).

This package offers robust and scalable anomaly detection for real-time data analysis.

### References

- **sklearn.neighbors.LocalOutlierFactor**  
  The Local Outlier Factor (LOF) implementation from scikit-learn is designed for static datasets and is a widely used method for unsupervised outlier detection. While EILOF shares conceptual similarities, it extends LOF to handle incremental updates for streaming data efficiently.  
  Documentation: [scikit-learn LocalOutlierFactor](https://scikit-learn.org/dev/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.LocalOutlierFactor.html)

#### Introduction Example

EILOF builds upon the core concept of Local Outlier Factor (LOF), popularized by `sklearn.neighbors.LocalOutlierFactor`, and adapts it for real-time data streaming scenarios. While the traditional LOF method is well-suited for static datasets, EILOF provides incremental updates, making it ideal for large-scale, real-time applications.
